### This repo contains code to reproduce experimental results in AAAI Submission Effects of Learning Rates and Paremeterisation on Interpretability of Transformers

To generate Figure 2- Run the files AAAI-Fig-2-Heatmaps_Diff_Eqs_Simulation and Fig-2_CACO_FAFO Experiments

To generate Figure 3 - Run the file Fig-3_Fixed-Self-Attention-Experiments_Collapsed, Fig-3_Fixed-Self-Attention-Experiments_Factorised

To generate Figure 4 - Run the file AAAI-Fig-2-Heatmaps_Diff_Eqs_Simulation

To generate Figure 5 - Run the files SVA_Faster_Query-Key, SVA_Same_LR, HateXplain_Faster_Query-Key, and HateXplain_Same_LR

To generate Figure 6 - Run the files Squad_QA_Same_LR, and Squad_QA_Faster_Query_Key_Learning
